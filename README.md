##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a repository for the Week 4 project. It contains R scripts, a Codebook,
and a tidy data set. The repository includes the following files: Codebook.md, run_analysis.R, and tidydata.txt.

##Codebook.md
The Codebook.md contains a codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.


##Run_analysis.R
The run_analysis.R file contains the code needed to perform the analysis 
required for this assignment.The code shows the code for the following tasks. 

1)Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the new data set created in the task 4, create a tidy data set with the
average of each variable for each subject and activity

##tidydata.txt
The tidydata.txt is the file that contains the original data set cleaned and tidy. 
Here is the link to the tidy dataset:
